#33. A script will receive any number of filenames as arguments. It should check whether such  
#files already exist. If they do, then it       should be reported, if not then check if a         
#subdirectory "mydir" exists or not in the current directory, if it doesnt exist then it         
#should be created and in it the files supplied as arguments should be created.
